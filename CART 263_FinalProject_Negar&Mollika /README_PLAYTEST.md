### Proof of Concept: 
The story is a reimagination of how dinosaurs became extinct through the asteroid attacks and volcanic eruptions that led to extreme climatic modifications. 

### Game Process:  
The game requires 2 players: user 1 is the dino and user 2 is the asteroid. It will depend upon the players to select the form of interaction they are willing to perform. There are asteroids and volcanic globules coming from different directions in space where the dinosaur is jumping from one planet to another trying to survive and reach its final destination, the Earth. The trick here is to control the movements, especially the jumping, not by using the keyboard interaction or mouse, but by using speech recognition. The dinosaur will jump when the user demands it to jump. First player will proceed in the game by saying “jump” and the second user will be using mouse interactions to fire the asteroids or volcano globules with the target of preventing the dinosaur from achieving its ultimate quest. 

### Inspirations:  
Angry Birds, Doodle Jump, Chrome Dino

### Feedback:
* Determine the mechanics of the game
* The dino is escaping planet X to go to earth, or is it going from earth to another planet?
* How to make the game last, creating a plain and fair field for both players
* Is there a way to reduce the delay of executing the jump, if not, incorporate the slowness into the game: Add a recharge aspect for both the dino and asteroids ( for example the asteroid can be shot only every 5 seconds).
* Different color asteroids with different damage levels.
* If dino wins, have the dino pop on a spaceship at the end of the game to another planet.
* If an asteroid wins, kill the last dinosaur and change the course of evolution (?) 
* Add a health level for dino
* Add a counter for the number of asteroids left 
* Add the title of the planet and location
* Add a parallax effect through a moving background to create an illusion that the dino is actually running

### To be considered:
* dd a shield power for the dino to catch
* Create 3d objects
* MQTT or single device
* Other libraries like p5.play
* Add steps dino can jump on
* Add different character styles for the user to have variations. 
* reate multiple environments to give a vibrant look and feel to the game.

### Initial process and the specifics:
* Make the dino only jump not bounce
* Make the asteroid 
* Determine if dino is moving on the horizontal or vertical direction
* Design of dino
