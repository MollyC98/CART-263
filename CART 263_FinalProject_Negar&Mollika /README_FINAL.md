### Proof of Concept: 
This project explores an imaginative world for a little Dinosaur who has been exint from earth due to asteroid attacks and volcanic disruptions leading to extreme climatic variations. But now it is set to travel to other nearest planet Mars. With the use of the speech library Annyang we have given a different style to the game playing experience in a hope that the players or users would have fun to interact with it. 

### Motivation 

Why we decided to go with a speech library? Speech library is not very often used for a game because it has its constraints, it takes some ammount of time to load and process the command as speech is a very abstract non certain form of human expression. Everybody has a different voice, different way of pronounciation. Therefore, we took it as a challenge to stick to the concept and make it work. We tried many diffrent speech commands and different speech libraries out there. What we learned from the process is; continuous same commands makes it confusing for the library to detect therefore if we use synonymous words alternatively, the speech library can be a wonderful tool to work with. 

### Game Process: 
* The game requires 2 players to be in the same environment, users can choose their players, if it's Player 1 
that is our main character Dinosaur (Dino) and if it;s player 2, that is the asteroid shooter. 

* The movement of the Player 1 (Dino) is contolled using speech recognition.

* The movement of the asteroid shooter is controlled using the left and right arrow keys and space key to fire asteroids. 

* The controls and commands for the games are explained in the "instructions" page for the easy accesibility to the users and building upon convinient user experience practices.

### Library Scripts Used 
* <script src="js/libraries/p5.min.js"></script>

* <script src="js/libraries/p5.sound.min.js"></script>

* <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/annyang/2.6.0/annyang.min.js"></script>

* <script src="js/libraries/p5.dom.min.js"></script>

### Feedback:
* Try to incorrporate the fun personalities (of the authors) into the character to make the users laugh 
while they are interacting with the game.

* Try to develop the gae further by creating levels and let the character Dino explore more spaces.

* Add more commands in the game so that the user doesn't feel monotonous toggling through just 2 commands.

* Try to add more mechanics that hides the constraints of the game and make users feel the constraints are the part of the game helping them feel more inclusive and connected to the game. 

* Add more floating elements in the space so that the action area of the game doesn't feel restricted to just the bottom part of the canvas, rather it feels the whole space in the canvas is being utilised. 

### Differences in relation to playtest 

* During playtest we wanted the Dinosaur to travel through various planets and come back to Earth that concept was modified due to technical and time constraints and we decided on to let Dinosaur make it to a single planet (Mars) first. 

* We were using p5.js speech library at first but changes it to Annyang speech library and it gave faster results.

* Inclusion of a 3D environment was thought of but we only could incorporate the parralax background and rest of the game is 2D in nature as the file started getting heavier with aesthetics. 

### Teamwork Experience 

* We both had our qualities to work with and drawbacks to work upon but were able to help each other during the whole process. 
* We had good communication which resolved a lot of problems 
* It was a beautiful experience to create a game together and we both acknowledged each other's contributions in coding and aesthetics. 

### Acheivements 

* We tried this game with other users apart from our classmates and they had amazing responses which made us feel proud of our work 

* Our way of working with code improved a lot from where we started 

* We were pround to make a game by ourselved that functions the way we exactly wanted it to 

* Learned and explored new ways to implement our imagination to code. 

### Challenges 

* Working with the speech library and making the character move according to the commands so that it doesn't lag. 

* Working the math for the asteroid shooter so that it shoot asteroids according to its rotation angle. 

* Working with high quality graphics, it was challenging for both of us and our computers. 

### Overview 

This project has been a beautiful journey for 2 game enthusiasts, both of us had it clear from the initiation that we wanted to develop a game. Our communication throughout the process has been incredible and we filled each other's drawbacks and made utilization of each other's strengths. This is the first game we have ever created and is very special to us. We hope we were able to make our users laugh and have fun with a different quirly style of game play experience. We learned lot and will be carrying this knowledge further in our future endeavours of game making experience and would try our best to work on the feedbacks received from the experts and fellow mates. We are grateful for this beautiful journey and Thank everybody who has been a part of it.
