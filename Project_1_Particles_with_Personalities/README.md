# CART 263 PROJECT 1; PARTICLES WITH PERSONALITIES 

## TOPIC; IN A PARTY, LOVING IT 

## Overview 

* The project; particles with personalities describe the creation of a particle system with varied interesting shapes,forms, colours,etc. that defines the characteristics of the particles as per the individual topics given to us. I was given the topic; In a party, loving it! 

* The project helps us with descriptive understanding of class or objects coding. I personally have utilised the FFT from p5.js Sound library and linked it with my particles to have different variations in terms of colours, speed and number of particles analysing the frequency of the selected music within the code. 

## Description of the process 
* The code uses the average of the frequency detected in the sound file by FFT analyze from p5.js sound library which is fast fourier transform to make changes in the speed,direction,color of the particles.
* Different values asre assigned to the each stage of the sound according to which the particles react within the system 
* The background is in HSB color mode and plays with the sine angle of the hues which are further mapped to the values that would give bright, dynamic, animated background for the project in complince to the theme. 
* The whole project is then set to a loop, as soon as the end of the sound is marked the whole animation resets itself to the start and plays again, with a simple interactivity of mouse Pressed. 

## Process 
* Because the topics were provided long back to us it gave enough time to think how the presentation would look like.
* I wanted to play with bright flashy background and this project gave me that change to experiment with it.
* I struggles with connecting the sound as i wanted to use FFT that I have used before for a project, which acted as a reference for me to use it again to calculate the average of frequencies and make particles react to it.
* I used the p5.js reference page for multiple example to on to toggle the colors in the background and play with the speed. 
* At first I started with ellipse as that has been showe din class and later I modified the shapes. 
* Making the star was bit complex than other shapes but I finally decided to remove ellipses totally and only use fun shapes like stars, triangle and squares. 
* Took me a long time to figure out the directional changes of the particles but it was extremely fun to understand and work with 
* I am glad to be able to do this project, it was definitely challenging but equivalently fun and an opportunity to think beyond.
