## Exercise 1: Ping Pong Ball Game Development using p5.js 

## Overview 

* This exercise has been an exceptional learning curve and was give to jog our memories after the festive breaks, the objective was to recreate or improvize a well known game called ping pong ball/tic tac toe. 

## Description of the Exercise 

* There were several set of rules to be met in the exercise, the ball needed to bounce between the two sliders at each end of the playing canvas or court. The rectangles or the sliders in each end represent the players. Every time the opposite side player misses the ball the other player scores and the ball gets back to the origin which is the centre of the court. The player that scores 10 first is declared to be the winner of the game.

## Process 

* I already decided on the size of my canvas and wanted it to be not too covering but also not extremely constricted.
* Designing the elements or objects of the game alongside designing the court was comparitavely easy. 
* The most challenging was the abrupt bouncing of the ball and collision with the sliders. 
* Some more difficulties included, stopping it after the scoreboard declares a winner, but it could be solved 
* I wanted to restart the game from the start but I couldn't figure the proper way, it was getting complicated for code that was working so I had to give up on it. 
* I learned a lot of things during the process, it was exciting to work on this project except the tough part.
